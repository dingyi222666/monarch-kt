# monarch-kt

A kotlin port of [monarch](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/monarch.html).

The monarch library can allow you to specify an efficient syntax highlighter, using a declarative lexical
specification. The specification is expressive enough to specify sophisticated highlighters
with complex state transitions, dynamic brace matching, auto-completion, other language embeddings, etc. as shown in
the 'advanced' topic sections of this document. On a first read, it is safe to skip any section or paragraph marked as (
Advanced) since many of the advanced features are rarely used in most language definitions.
